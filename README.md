# Project-Fletching
The the goal of this project is to create a simple tool to compare vocabulary usage at the book and chapter level in various majority language source Bible Translations used by Bible translation projects.

Project Fletching is a dynamic comparison tool which will allows Bible translators to select their source Bible Translation and Scripture Portions and get percentage ranked suggestions based vocabulary similarity of what chapters/books of scripture have the highest percentages of shared vocabulary. The purpose of this ranking is to help translations teams make strategic decisions about optimizing vocabulary and possibly grammatical similarity between previously translated scripture portions and the next portions to be translated. For teams hoping to use AI generated zero drafts in their translation process, this information may help them establish a "path" for future translation. 

Current Workflow:
1. Users load a "standard corpus" Excel file.
2. Users load multiple Excel files to compare.
3. The program calculates the similarity between the standard corpus and each selected file.



Future Research Directions

A future research goal of this project is to include grammatical constructions in the source text as another crossreferencing option to sort results.
